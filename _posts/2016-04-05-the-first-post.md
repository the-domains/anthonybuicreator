THE FIRST POST

Let's see how this thing works out. 

My name is Anthony. I am a creator. 

Of what?

Well, a lot of things. 

I've drawn. I've painted. I've photographed and designed. I've helped build websites and applications--[this one][0] even got popular in China. 

I like making things with my hands too. I've built furniture--a dining table, a bench, some shelves, even a dresser using 100 year old barn wood. 

Mostly I've made videos. Short format ones. From [branded content][1], to [viral content][2], to [commercial content][3]. If Content is King, I'm close friends with him. 

I've recently created the most important and magical thing though--a baby girl we're naming Matisse.
